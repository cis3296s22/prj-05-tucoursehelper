Temple Course Helper is an application that will take the users' course numbers and find the course information from the catalog on Temple's website as well as teacher ratings from Rate My Professor. The application will take all of this information and store it on a database along with the student ID entered. On the screen, all of the information (course time, cost, professor, rating, description) will be displayed, and the user will be asked if they would like to be sent this information as well.

You can run this code by simply clicking the executable file which will take you straight to the interactive UI.
