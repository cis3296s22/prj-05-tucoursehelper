# Temple Course Helper
Temple Course Helper is an application that will take the users' course numbers and find the course information from the catalog on Temple's website as well as teacher ratings from Rate My Professor. The application will take all of this information and store it on a database along with the student ID entered. On the screen, all of the information (course time, cost, professor, rating, description) will be displayed, and the user will be asked if they would like to be sent this information as well.

# Vision Statement

For Temple’s students, their parents and professors who need an easier and more informative course-info software the Temple Course Helper is an application that will make finding information about courses and professors easier than ever. Unlike Temple’s website or other websites, our product is open for everyone to use, provides all the information in one application, stores this information and sends them to the user.
